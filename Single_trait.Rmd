##  Data

Both datasets contain data for 344 penguins. There are 3 different species of penguins in this dataset, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

##  Single trait distribution  
###  Bill length differences
The bill length is significantly different between species of penguins

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm, color = species))
```




##  Sexual Dimorphism

The size of the bills varies by sex and by species
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm, color = sex))
```
